Description:<br />
<b>B1.</b> The virtual table with 3D Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms that correspond to those used in the recorded video from A2 can be visualized.<br />
<b>B1-1.</b>The consistent theme of a classroom is being utilized in a 3D virtual environment (VE) that is suitable for VR.<br />
<b>B2.</b> The user is able to use a grab interaction to pick up atom and molecule objects to translate them in the environment.<br />
<b>B3.</b> The user is able to use an attach interaction to join Hydrogen and Oxygen atom objects with a bond to eventually construct a H2O molecule. The presence of bonds between atoms is visually evident.<br />
<b>B4.</b> The user is ableto use a rotate interaction to rotate molecules.<br />
<b>B5.</b> The user is able to use a pinch interaction to scale molecules.<br />
<b>B6.</b> The user is able to virtually navigate the virtual environment with a locomotion method - teleportation.<br />
