## B1
incomplete-looking 3D scene
                                        
## B2
desktop-based grab and translate interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B3
desktop-based attach interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B4
desktop-based rotate interaction exists and works well
                                        
## B5
desktop-based "pinch" interaction exists and works well
                                        
## B6
desktop-based locomotion interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## Other feedback
Unclear README instructions;

Interactions are buggy;

Sometimes teleport away when interacting with objects;
